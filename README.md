## LDA topic modeling notebooks for DIGI405: Texts, Discourses and Data
(These are for the on-campus version of this course).

There are two notebooks here:
- A 'tiny corpus' set of toy examples to allow students to tinker with LDA parameters and easily see the effects. This notebook was written by Christopher Thomson.
- One demonstrating LDA topic modeling using tomotopy and the 20 Newsgroups dataset. This notebook was written by Christopher Thomson with contributions by Geoff Ford and Karin Stahel. We also draw on code written by Melanie Walsh.
